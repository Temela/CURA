## ✨ About CURA

**CURA** is a Human-Centered Computing (HCC) initiative that integrates technology, ethics, and pastoral sensitivity to monitor and support the health of elderly clergy. Designed by a Catholic priest and data scientist, it captures not just physical metrics but also emotional and spiritual well-being—offering compassionate care through code.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Provide a health dashboard for elderly religious members  
- Predict early signs of health deterioration (e.g., cardiovascular issues)  
- Respect spiritual life and emotional states through daily reflections  
- Design for accessibility: large font, low-tech interfaces, and voice options  
- Center care, privacy, and dignity in all AI decisions
