## 1. Introduction
CURA is a human-centered health tracking and well-being system designed for aging religious members. It supports physical, emotional, and spiritual care using data-driven tools without compromising dignity or autonomy. Rooted in Catholic social thought and HCI ethics, CURA reflects a theology of presence and care.

## 2. Motivation
Elderly priests and religious often experience isolation, unmonitored health decline, and underreported mental stress. Existing health tech rarely includes:
- Emotional states tied to spiritual practice
- Ethical design for aging communities
- Interfaces suitable for cognitive or motor decline

---

## 3. Methodology
CURA gathers daily inputs including:
- Vital signs (heart rate, BP)
- Mood and activity
- Medication compliance
- Spiritual reflections

It integrates:
- A predictive health model (cardiovascular risk)
- Accessible interfaces (voice input, large type)
- Visual dashboards for caregivers
- Secure, locally stored data

---

## 4. Ethical Considerations

### a. Data Privacy
- No cloud sharing without consent
- Anonymization for analysis
- Stored locally where possible

### b. AI Transparency
- Models designed to be explainable
- Decisions (e.g., high risk alerts) require human review

### c. Design for Dignity
- Mood/spiritual inputs help prevent reductionism
- Interface respects aging bodies: fewer taps, no endless forms

### d. Faith-Integrated Wellness
- Daily reflections encourage self-awareness and peace
- Ethical decisions guided by principles from Catholic Social Teaching:
  - Human dignity
  - Solidarity
  - Preferential option for the vulnerable

## 5. Human-Centered Design (HCD) Principles Applied
- **Empathy**: Interfaces shaped by interviews with retired clergy
- **Accessibility**: Contrast, readability, voice input
- **Feedback Loops**: Immediate visualization of personal health
- **Customization**: Journaling language adapts to the user

---

## 6. Future Work
- Piloting in diocesan homes and religious communities
- Publication in HCI, medical ethics, and digital health journals
- Adding wearable IoT integration (non-invasive vitals)
- Developing a mobile-friendly version

---

## 7. Conclusion
CURA is not just a system. It’s an act of care. A testament to the belief that data, when designed with love and theology, can serve—not erase—human dignity.
